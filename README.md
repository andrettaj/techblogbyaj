NOTE:  A work in progress code and not completed.
Once this code is completed, this will be a blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on the other developers' posts as well. 

This code is a code that connects the front and the back in together, in which I am still in the process of learning.  

This code was taken from the mini project in module 14 in which I updated  and changed from the project to the blog and posts that will apply to this project.  I will continue to work on this project until get the desired results, however, as of now, this is what I am able to accomplish.

This is a code that is still a work in progress, however the image provided below is how the finished project will look once completed.
